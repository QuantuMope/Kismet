# Kismet
Turn-based combat, 2D side-scrolling platformer videogame. Coded entirely in python using pygame.

It is an ongoing project that I work on in my free time. I hope to some day to finish the game and publish it to Steam.

**Warning: The .exe file is often not updated. The .exe file is just a way for me to test whether or not the code is compatible on other Windows platforms. Better to run the Kismet.py while project is in progress.**
