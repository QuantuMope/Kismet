# Kismet
### Turn-based combat, 2D side-scrolling platformer videogame coded entirely in python

A project that I work on in my free time. I hope to some day to finish the game and publish it to Steam.
Currently on hold as I attend graduate studies.

To run simply
```python
python3 kismet.py
```
 
### !!! - It should be noted that some areas of the code require major refactoring.
