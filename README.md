Turn-based combat, 2D side-scrolling platformer videogame. Coded entirely in python using pygame.
Instead of using engines such as Unity, decided to code the game using pygame as a programming challenge for myself.

It is an ongoing project that I work on in my free time. I hope to some day to finish the game and publish it to Steam.

**Warning: The .exe file is often not updated. The .exe file is just a way for me to test whether or not the code is compatible on other Windows platforms. Better to run the actual python script while project is in progress.
